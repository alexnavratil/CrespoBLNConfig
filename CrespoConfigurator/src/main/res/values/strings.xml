        This app allows you to disable the backlight on the capacitive buttons (back - menu - search - home) when the screen is turned off.
        Check the checkbox if you want to enable the backlight when you receive a new notification. Uncheck the checkbox if the backlight should be turned off when the screen is turned off.\n\n
