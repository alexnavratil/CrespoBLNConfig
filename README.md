CrespoBLNConfig
===============
This app allows you to turn on/off the BLN on a Nexus S (crespo).
I developed this app because in CyanogenMod 10.1 there was an option to disable BLN.
In CyanogenMod 10.2 there is no option to disable BLN.
I know that copy the CrespoParts.apk to /system/app will bring back that
function but the disadvantage is that you must copy this file after each update.
Just install the CrespoBLNConfig.apk and then check the option you want.

This App needs *root*.
I'm not responsible for any damages.
If you point the finger at me for messing up your device, I will laugh at you.
